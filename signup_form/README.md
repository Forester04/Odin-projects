# Project: Sign-up Form

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a web page based on a provided design file. The web page will feature a sign-up form for a service named "ODIN." The project requires setting up HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript files to create the desired layout and functionality.

## Technologies Used

    HTML: Used for structuring the content of the web page.
    CSS: Utilized for styling and layout of the web page elements.
    JavaScript: May be used for client-side validation, particularly to check if the password fields match.
    Git: Version control system to manage project changes and collaboration.

## Project Steps
Step 1: Set up and Planning

    Git Repository: Set up a Git repository to track project changes and collaborate if necessary.
    HTML and CSS Files: Create HTML and CSS files and link them to ensure proper structure and styling.
    Download Design File: Obtain a full-resolution copy of the design file provided for reference.

Step 2: Gather Assets

    Background Image: Download a suitable background image for the webpage, ensuring it aligns with the design aesthetics.
    External Fonts: Choose an appropriate external font for the 'logo' section, considering readability and design compatibility.
    Odin Logo: Download the Odin logo image for the image-sidebar section.

Step 3: Implementation Tips

    Structural Scaffolding: Begin by outlining the structure of the webpage and then focus on implementing individual sections.
    Background Enhancements: Apply a semi-transparent dark background color behind the "ODIN" logo section to improve text readability.
    Styling Considerations: Use specific colors and styles for elements like the 'Create Account' button, input fields, and password inputs with error classes.
    Responsive Design: While mobile responsiveness is not required, ensure the page is not completely broken at different desktop resolutions.
    Password Field Validation: Implement JavaScript for checking if the password fields match, providing a seamless user experience.
